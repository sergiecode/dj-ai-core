   - Test feature scaling and normalization
   - Analyze feature importance

3. **Model_Development.ipynb**
   - Prototype ML models
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model comparison and evaluation

4. **Transition_Analysis.ipynb**
   - Analyze successful DJ transitions
   - Identify patterns in track compatibility
   - Develop transition scoring algorithms

5. **Performance_Optimization.ipynb**
   - Profile code performance
   - Optimize audio processing pipelines
   - Test batch processing efficiency

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install Jupyter in your virtual environment
pip install jupyter

# Start Jupyter server
jupyter notebook

# Or use JupyterLab
pip install jupyterlab
jupyter lab
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive notebook names
- Include markdown cells with explanations
- Clear outputs before committing
- Save important findings in markdown summaries
