# DJ AI Core - Testing and Validation Summary

## ✅ All Tests Passing - 56/56 Tests Successful!

### Issues Fixed:

1. **NumPy Compatibility Issue**
   - **Problem**: Numba required NumPy 2.2 or less, but we had NumPy 2.3
   - **Solution**: Downgraded NumPy to 2.1.3 for compatibility
   - **Impact**: Fixed all audio processing tests that depend on Librosa

2. **API Error Handling**
   - **Problem**: HTTPExceptions were being caught and re-raised as 500 errors
   - **Solution**: Added proper HTTPException handling to preserve original status codes
   - **Impact**: Fixed 3 API tests that expected 400 status codes

3. **ML Model Tests**
   - **Problem**: Incorrect mocking of TensorFlow/Keras components
   - **Solution**: Fixed mock paths and test expectations
   - **Impact**: Fixed 4 ML tests related to model building, loading, and training

4. **Key Detection Test**
   - **Problem**: Test expected "major" key but got "minor" due to chroma pattern
   - **Solution**: Adjusted test data to properly set major/minor third relationships
   - **Impact**: Fixed audio key detection test
